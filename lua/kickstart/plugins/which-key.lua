-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
--
-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
--
-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
--  event = 'VimEnter'
--
-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
--
-- Then, because we use the `opts` key (recommended), the configuration runs
-- after the plugin has been loaded as `require(MODULE).setup(opts)`.

---@type LazySpec

  { -- Useful plugin to show you pending keybinds.
